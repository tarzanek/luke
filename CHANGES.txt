  Changes in v. 1.0.1 (released on 2010.04.01):

   This release upgrades to Lucene 3.0.1 jars.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Issue 5: Field value decoder for 32 bit numeric fields (float,
            int) missing.
          + Added support for XmlQueryParser.
          + Issue 12: Add option to specify custom XmlQueryParser.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Issue 3: Analyzer plugin (and analyzers) don't work.
          + Issue 4: Compress flag no longer available.
          + Issue 14: Error while using custom similarity.

  Changes in v. 1.0.0 (released on 2009.12.23):

   This release just upgrades to Lucene 3.0 jars.

  Changes in v. 0.9.9.1 (released on 2009.11.20):

   This release upgrades to Lucene 2.9.1 jars and Hadoop 0.20.1 jars.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Add per-field value decoders, for displaying field values that
            should be interpreted as numeric or date or binary values.
          + Improve the Analysis plugin to switch between the mixed and
            the only-new API.
          + Improve visibility and layout of Thinlet tables.
          + Add display of commit user data Map.
          + Add ability to edit per-commit user data Map
     * Bug fixes:
          + Term frequency vectors were not displayed for selected field
            (reported by Benjamin Heilbrunn).

  Changes in v. 0.9.9 (released on 2009.09.30):

   This release upgrades to Lucene 2.9.0 jars.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Luke can now open multiple indexes found in subdirectories one
            level below the selected directory.
          + Added Hadoop Plugin for working with indexes on Hadoop file
            systems. This uses Hadoop 0.19.2 and dependencies released
            with this release of Hadoop. The plugin uses partial local
            caching to speed up some operations.
          + Term counts and percentages are calculated in a background
            thread, so the opening of large indexes should be a little
            faster. Also, this operation is skipped for indexes accessed
            over slow IO (such as HDFS).
          + Added More Like This query builder from current document (or
            its selected fields).
          + Search time is now monitored using System.nanoTime, and the
            last search time is preserved in the UI.
          + Search can be now repeated N times to get a better estimate of
            average search time. Note: the measured time involves only the
            search(), not the retrieval of documents.
          + AnalyzerTool plugin now uses and illustrates the new token
            Attribute API.
          + Nearly all uses of deprecated Lucene API are replaced with the
            new API.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fix a counter-intuitive behavior where in the Open dialog Luke
            chops off the last path element from previously used index
            path.
          + Fix XMLExporter entity escaping, and add a missing quote in
            term vector size.
          + Fix a long-standing Thinlet bug related to tabbedpane with
            many tabs - now tabs don't "overflow" the tabbedpane area thus
            corrupting the display of surrounding components.

  Changes in v. 0.9.2 (released on 2009.03.20):

   This release upgrades to Lucene 2.4.1 jars.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added term counts per field in Overview - contributed by Mark
            Harwood.
          + Improved the Analysis plugin to show all token information,
            and highlight whenever a token is selected from the list.
     * Bug fixes:
          + (None)

  Changes in v. 0.9.1 (released on 2008.11.22):

   This is mostly a bug fix release of 0.9.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added ability to set the maximum count of boolean clauses in
            BooleanQuery.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Unbalanced <commit> tags breaking the XML export. Reported by
            Teruhiko Kurosaka.
          + Opening a non-existent index from command-line creates an
            empty directory. Reported by Chris Pimlott. See also
            LUCENE-1464.
          + IndexGate inadvertently deleting previous commit points, even
            if "Keep all commits" option was specified. Reported by Mark
            Harwood.
          + Empty index with no fields was reported as invalid. Discovered
            by Andrew Zhang and Michael McCandless (LUCENE-1454).

  Changes in v. 0.9 (released on 2008.11.15):

   This release adds many functionality enhancements and advanced features
   available in Lucene 2.4.
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added new tools:
               o Check Index - checks Lucene indexes for problems, and can
                 fix some of them. This is a GUI front-end to the Lucene
                 CheckIndex tool.
               o Export to XML - exports index data and metadata to XML
                 file. This is available both from the GUI and from the
                 command-line.
          + Significantly improved Optimize and Cleanup tools.
          + Added ability to set norms on any indexed field in a document,
            or a range of documents.
          + Delete multiple documents by specifying ranges of document
            numbers.
          + Added support for new field functionality: omitTF and binary
            fields.
          + Improve the low-level information about the index, including
            format version.
          + Show interesting details about IndexCommit points and
            associated files.
          + Add short explanations of index files' functions.
          + Improve document reconstruction - now the information from
            TermFreqVector can be used if available. Also,
            DocReconstructor can be used outside of Luke.
          + Significantly improved advanced search options - QueryParser
            settings, Similarity and HitCollector settings.
          + Read-only functionality is supported directly in IndexReader.
     * Bug fixes:
       A lot of effort went into refactoring the code, moving away if
       possible from the spaghetti code influenced by Thinlet and into a
       modular design. Still much needs to be done here. :(
       This means that there are likely many more bugs than in the
       previous release, although I tested all functionality to make sure
       that there is no data loss.
       HOWEVER, if you work with precious data, it's always a good idea to
       use the "Read-only" option.

  Changes in v. 0.8.1 (released on 2008.02.13):

   This release adds a few functionality enhancements related to
   TermVectors and Payloads.
     * New features and improvements:
          + When editing document fields it's now possible to specify
            TermVectors with offsets and/or positions.
          + Added ability to show term vector positions and offsets, if
            available. It's also possible to copy this list to the
            clipboard.
          + Added ability to show term positions within a document, and
            display term payloads if available, using one of several
            pre-defined payload decoders. It's also possible to copy this
            list to the clipboard.
          + It's possible now to view the full content of a stored field
            using various content decoders (hex, date / time, number,
            utf8, arrays of int or float)
          + Layout of "Browse by Term" panel is changed so that it better
            reflects the available navigation.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Check added to prevent from adding new documents if no index
            is open.
          + Wrong class was used in IndexGate to represent deletable
            files, which caused a ClassCastException.
          + Some query types may have been skipped when displaying
            Explanation.

  Changes in v. 0.8 (released on 2008.02.04):

   This release upgrades to the official Lucene 2.3.0 release JARs.

   NOTE: this version of Luke requires Java 1.5 or higher.

   The following changes have been made in this release:
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added ability to show full text of a field in a popup dialog,
            both in plain text and as a hexadecimal dump.
          + It's also possible to save the content of a single field to an
            external file. This is useful for saving binary fields, or
            examining exact byte content of a field.
          + Added an option to load the index to RAMDirectory. NOTE:
            obviously you should take into account the index size vs. the
            available heap size ... ;)
          + GrowableStringArray is a separate public class now - perhaps
            some day I'll use it to implement a bulk document reconstruct
            function.
          + Luke remembers now the last Analyzer and last field used in
            previous session.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Neither the document nor the field details have the "Boost"
            column anymore, it's always 1.0f in documents retrieved from
            an index. Instead this column now reads "Norms" and shows the
            fieldNorm value of a field.

  Changes in v. 0.7.1 (released on 2007.06.20):

   This minor release is mostly an upgrade to the official Lucene 2.2.0
   release JARs.

   The following changes have been made in this release:
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added a term distribution analysis plugin by Mark Harwood.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed IndexGate class to correctly show deletable files.

  Changes in v. 0.7 (released on 2007.02.20):

   This release uses the official Lucene 2.1.0 release JARs.

   The following changes have been made in this release:
     * New features and improvements:
          + Added pagination of results, especially useful for very large
            result sets.
          + Added support for new Field flags. They are now displayed in
            the Document details, and also can be set on edited documents.
          + Added a function to add new documents to the index.
          + Low-level index operations (such as detecting unused files,
            index directory cleanup) use the newly exposed Lucene classes
            instead of duplicating their internals in Luke.
          + A side-effect of the above is the ability to properly cleanup
            all supported index formats, including the new lockless and
            single-norm indexes.
          + Added a function to copy the list of top terms to clipboard.
          + Added a function to copy the term vector to clipboard.
          + Added a function to close and/or re-open the current index.
          + In the Documents tab, pressing "First Term" now positions the
            term enumeration at the first term for the selected field.
          + Added a field vocabulary analysis plugin by Mark Harwood, with
            some modifications.
          + Overall UI cleanup - improved layout in some places, added
            graphics instead of ASCII art, etc.
     * Bug fixes:
          + Fixed a bug in index size calculation.
          + Fixed a bug in term browsing - when "First Term" was pressed
            in reality the second term was shown.

   The following people contributed patches, suggestions, and generally
   kept prodding me and poking to produce this release: Volodymyr
   Bychkoviak, Juan Manuel Caicedo, Mark Harwood, Otis Gospodnetic, Benson
   Margulies, Jean-Philippe Robichaud, and many, many others. Thank you
   for your support!

  Changes in v. 0.6:

   This release uses Lucene JAR named lucene-1.9-rc1-dev.jar. This JAR and
   all other JARs from Lucene repository were built from SVN revision
   154013.

   This release adds new important features such as custom Similarity and
   JavaScript scripting (using Mozilla Rhino engine). Here's a more
   detailed list of changes and bugfixes:
     * New features, improvements and bug fixes:
          + The query view shows not only a parsed form, but also a
            re-written query form.
          + Query Explanation shows internal structure of a query.
            Explanations are provided both for the parsed and rewritten
            queries.
          + Command-line argument parsing. Now you can open an index on
            startup, and optionally execute a script (see below)
          + Custom Similarity designer plugin, which allows you to design
            and test your own Similarity implementation.
          + Scripting plugin, which allows you to interactively experiment
            with Luke and Lucene indexes. This plugin also can run scripts
            from Luke command-line.
          + Ability to use MMapDirectory. Due to limitations in Lucene API
            this feature relies on reflection API, and may sometimes fail
            if a restrictive SecurityManager is in use. The Overview panel
            shows which Directory implementation is used.
          + Proper display of overlapping tokens (created with analyzers
            that use setPositionIncrement(0) ).
          + Field names are sorted in alphabetical order.
          + Document boost is shown, in addition to each field's boost.
          + The "Files" tab now shows which files found in the index
            directory really belong to the index, and what is their
            status.
          + A new function, "Index Cleanup", cleans up all files from
            index directory that do not belong to the index, and all files
            that are marked as deletable in the index.
          + Luke has been reviewed and restructured to provide better
            support for execution as a part of other applications (or
            JavaScript scripts). Javadoc comments were added.
          + The default binary bundle (lukeall.jar) now contains also a
            collection of analyzers from the "contrib" area, as well as
            the Snowball analyzers.
          + UI font selection: sometimes the field values contain
            characters not covered in the default 'dialog' font, like e.g.
            less common Unicode glyphs. Or maybe you just wish to view all
            UI text rendered in Garamond... now you can ;-)
          + UI color theme: you can now switch color themes for your eye's
            pleasure.
     * Bug fixes:
          +
